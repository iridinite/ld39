## Unobtainium

This is the source code my LD39 entry. It's a digging game: the deeper you go, the bigger rewards you reap. Upgrade your rig and look for the Unobtainium crystal all the way down - but keep an eye on your fuel meter.

This was made in 48 hours during LD39. The theme was "running out of power".
